## Motivation

If you're using styled-components/Emotion you probably wonder how to make your components more **interactive** and **scalable**? How to handle multiple variants and transitions? The Mentioned libraries care only about how to attach **css** to _React_ components and that's all. The only **intuitive** way of making transitions is `:hover`, `:active` selector. You can write **complex** logic to handle some touch events/keyframes and/or utilize **animation** libraries like _React Motion_. But then you end up with your style **fragmented** between those libraries...

And that's where **_Styled Benefits_** comes in. With its **intuitive API**. You can handle complex transitions right in your `styled` `css` tag, keeping the performance of **css transitions** and **keyframes**, using css-like **declarative** way to handle **variants**, and just be happy and productive again üòç

## Try It!

The **documentation** is full of the **live code examples**. Change some lines in the code below:

```jsx live
const Benefits = styled.img`
  width: 100px;
`

const Container = interactive(styled.div`
  width: 200px;
  height: 150px;
  display: flex;
  border-radius: 10px;
  justify-content: center;
  transition: all 0.2s;
  ${whileHold} {
    background: black;
    #logo {
      filter: drop-shadow(16px 16px 20px red) invert(90%);
    }
  }
  ${whileMouseHover} {
    transform: scale(1.2);
  }
`)

render(
  <Container>
    <Benefits src='/img/styled-benefits-logo.svg' alt='Logo' id='logo' />
  </Container>
)
```
